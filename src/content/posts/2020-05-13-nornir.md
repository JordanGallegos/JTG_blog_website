#Purpose#
This project will be an introduction to network automation using the Nornir automation Framework. [Read more about the Nornir automation framework here](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Using Nornir 3, I will be utilizing additional plugins such as jinja2 and netmiko to push a config to Cisco routers. More specifically, I will be automating the EIGRP dynamic routing configuration.

###Topology###
- 4 routers, 1 switch, and management cloud to allow ssh access from Ubuntu box on 192.168.13.1/24 network
  - Each router's gig 0/0 interface will be configured as a management port to allow ssh access from any device on the 192.168.13.1/24 network
  - This will allow us to push configs from an Ubuntu box at 192.168.13.3  
  <br>
  - R1 management interface: 192.168.13.11
  - R2 management interface: 192.168.13.12
  - R3 management interface: 192.168.13.13
  - R4 management interface: 192.168.13.14
  - Switch vlan1 : 192.168.13.9 (needs to be configured to allow traffic to reach router's management interfaces)

###Configurations###
####Router####
- Configured Routers in the topology
```
Commands used for router config: 
no ip domain-lookup
username jordan priv 15 pass cisco
ip domain-name tsm
ip ssh ver 2
crypto key generate rsa mod 1024
line vty 0 4
trans in ssh
login local
line aux 0
transport preferred none
exec-timeout 15 0
interface gig 0/0
ip address 192.168.13.11 255.255.255.0 (.1-.4) for each router
no shut
end
wr mem
copy running-config startup-config
```  
####Nornir####
- Installed Nornir in a python virtual environment on an ubuntu machine
  - [Click here for a video domostating the virtualenv setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5jxJE0LJYA)  
  - Nornir folder structure:  

  ![](/screenshots/nornirlab/folder.png)  

  - config.yml at the root of the folder
  - run.py python file that will run the code
  - Two folders (Inventory and Templates)
    - Inventory
      - defaults.yml
      - groups.yml
      - hosts.yml
    - Templates
      - eigrp.j2 (jinja2 template)

#####config.yml#####

R1:
    hostname: 192.168.13.11
    groups:
        - Router
    data:
        host: R1
        dynamic-network: 5

R2:
    hostname: 192.168.13.12
    groups:

        host: R2

R3:

    data:
        host: R3

    groups:
        - Router
    data:
        host: R4
        dynamic-network: 5

```
#####eigrp.j2#####
```
router eigrp {{ host['dynamic-network'] }}
no auto-summary
network 0.0.0.0
eigrp router-id {{ host['hostname'] }}

```

#####run.py#####
```
from nornir import InitNornir
from nornir_utils.plugins.functions import print_result, print_title
from nornir.core.task import Task, Result
from nornir_jinja2.plugins.tasks import template_file, template_string
from nornir_netmiko.tasks import netmiko_send_config

nr = InitNornir(config_file='config.yml', dry_run=True)

def basic_config(task):
    eigrp_config = task.run(task=template_file, 
                 template="eigrp.j2", 
                 path=f"templates/")
    eigrp_output = eigrp_config.result
    eigrp_send = eigrp_output.splitlines()  
    task.run(task=netmiko_send_config, config_commands=eigrp_send)

print_title("Runbook to configure EIGRP on the network")
result = nr.run(task=basic_config)
print_result(result)

```

#Conclusion#
- Confirmed configuration sent to R1 and R2

- Verified all routers had the EIGRP configuration

###Final Thoughts###
This was a difficult lab and required me to start over multiple times while creating the run.py script. Most of the Nornir documentation is for Nornir2 instead of Nornir3 which required me to amend more code than I expected. Although it took longer than anticipated, I still accomplished what I set out to do. I learned about additional Nornir plugins (jinja2 and netmiko) and worked on my python development skills.  
<br>
A few things I would add to this lab:
- Implementing EIGRP on the non-management interfaces
  - Although additional interfaces were shown in the topology, I only assigned IP addresses to the Router's MGMT interface  
  - Additional IP addressing was in the initial scope, but was left out due to time constraints
- Implementing EIGRP using a different plugin
  - Napalm_configure was the plugin I planned on using initially, but I was unsuccessful in getting it to configure the routers (used netmiko instead)
