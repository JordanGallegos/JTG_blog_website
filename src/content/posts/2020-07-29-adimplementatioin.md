#Purpose#
Implement an Active Directory environment containing four servers and two client desktops. The servers will run various roles and features including DNS, DHCP, and WSUS. This lab will provide me further efficiency relating to AD creation. And provide an introduction into the maintenance and implementation of DNS, DHCP, and WSUS on Windows Servers. 

###Topology###
![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/topology.png)  

- 4 Servers (Windows Server 2016)
  - DC1 | 10.10.10.2
      - DC
      - DNS
      - DHCP
  - DC2 | 10.10.10.3
      - DC
      - DNS  
  - WSUS | 10.10.10.5 and DHCP (Internet access)
      - WSUS
  - RODC | 10.10.10.4
      - RODC
      - DNS
  
  <br>
- 2 Clients (Windows 10) | ip via dhcp

- Network Switch (gateway) | 10.10.10.1
  - interconnects all devices on vlan 100

##Configuration##
####Switch####
- Configured cisco switch to act as a gateway (10.10.10.1) for the network
- Set all ports to access the same VLAN
```
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/0
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport access vlan 100
 switchport mode access
 negotiation auto
!
interface Vlan100
 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
```

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/setscope.png) 

- No exlusions needed as static IP addresses needed for the lab are set to IPv4 addresses out of the DHCP scope  

- Set lease time to default (8 days)  

- Set router IP address (gateway) as 10.10.10.1  

- Set other DNS server IP addresses to other servers  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/dhcpdns.png) 

####DC2####
####Add roles and features to DC2#####

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/dc2roles.png) 

####Domain Controller Promotion####  

- Set DC2 to connect as a domain controller from an existing domain  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/dc2connect.png)

- Used login credentials for admin account on DC1  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/dc2creds.png) 

- Used DSRM password set during initial forest creation and DNS server


![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/dsrmpw.png) 

- Unchecked DNS delegation, it will be configured manually from DC1 (parent zone)

- Selected defaults for remaining steps  

- DC2 joined to *local.jordantg.com* domain as a domain controller  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/d2joined.png) 


####RODC####  

####Set RODC as a read only domain controller##### 

- The Read Only Domain Controller will provide domain resiliency and a non-writable domain controller to a remote site

- Installed Domain Services and checked DNS  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/rodcroles.png) 

####Read Only Domain Controller Promotion####

- Used login credentials for DC1 to connect domain to *local.jordantg.com*  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/rodcconnect.png) 

- Used DSRM password set during initial forest creation, checked DNS and RODC

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/rodcdsrm.png) 

- Delegated the administrator account on DC1 as the account allowed to replicate passwords to RODC  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/rodcconfigure.png) 

- Unchecked DNS delegation, it will be configured manually from DC1 (parent zone)

- Selected defaults for remaining steps  

- RODC joined to *local.jordantg.com* domain as a domain controller  

![](/screenshots/activedirectoryonprem/rodcjoined.png) 

####WSUS####

###Final Thoughts###  

This lab served as a catch-all to gain experience with several roles and features in Windows Server. I had previous exposure to active directory forest creation. But DNS, DHCP, and WSUS implementation were entirely new concepts introduced to me in this lab. The DNS and DHCP features were added without any issues. I was able to verify proper DNS forward lookups from the administrative DNS tool installed on DC1. The DHCP administrative tool on DC1 allowed me to verify proper DHCP leases. The most difficult portion of this lab was the WSUS implementation. WSUS was an entirely new concept to me. While I had not implemented some of the other roles in the past, I still had a comfortable knowledge of the theory. For WSUS, I did not have any previous theoretical or practical knowledge. The issue that arose while implementing WSUS was related to the clients not populating in the Update Services table on the WSUS server. After manually trying to point the clients to the update server (10.10.10.5:8530), I resolved the issue by defining the update server in the default domain policy of *local.jordantg.com*. 

I improved my overall competency with Windows Server as this lab was rich with challenges. If I were to add to this lab in the future, I would add another server and configure it to be a print server and file server. It would allow me to emulate a client connecting to a network share and network printer.
