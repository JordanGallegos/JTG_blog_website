#Purpose#
To successfully implement a Cisco Lightweight Access Point using Cisco's vWLC in Eve-NG

###Topology###
- ESXi Server hosting Eve-NG
  - 3rd physical NIC configured with VLAN 13 as its port-group  

  ![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/esxinic.png)  
  - vWLC configured in Eve-NG at 172.16.0.3  

  ![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/evetopo.png)  
- Physical Cisco 3550 Switch
  - Trunk port on fastEthernet 0/13 for VLAN 13
  - Access port on fastEthernet 0/15 for VLAN 13
  - DHCP pool for 172.16.0.0/24 network  
  <br>
- Physical 1142 Lightweight Access Point to connect to vWLC

####Connecting 1142 Wireless AP to vWLC####
- Logged into WLC, showed one AP online  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/1apup.png) 

- Created new WLAN under, WLANs  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/newwlan.png) 

- Assigned new SSID and Profile Name  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/newssid.png) 

- Set security to WPA+WPA2 with a PSK
  - Ideally in an enterprise set up an 802.1x, LDAP, or AAA server should be used for authenticating clients  


![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/security.png) 

- Enabled and applied WLAN

-  Added AP Group  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/addedgroup.png) 

- Added AP_Test as a new AP Group and selected it 

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/addedaptest.png) 

- Added new SSID from WLANs tab  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/newwlanssid.png) 
![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/newwlanssid2.png) 

- Selected the 1142AP and added it to the AP_Test group

#Conclusion#

- AP booted back up with an IP address on the 172.16.0.0/24 network  

![](/screenshots/wirelesslab/apboot.png)

- Confirmed AP was in AP_Test group

###Final Thoughts###
This lab allowed me the opportunity to re-familiarize myself with wireless concepts that I had not reviewed since last August. This was my first time working with a Wireless Lan Controller, and using the vWLC in Eve-NG allowed me more flexibility than Cisco Packet Tracer. Some issues I had while completing this LAB revolved around the AP not properly broadcasting the AP_Test SSID. I was able to resolve the issue by changing the AP Mode to flexconnect. To add improvements to the topology, I will create VLAN 13 as an SVI, thus allowing me to route the Internet to that VLAN. I would also add multiple SSIDs to broadcast, a production SSID, and a guest SSID with a captive portal.
